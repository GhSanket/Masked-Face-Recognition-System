Build a face detection-based solution which can identify the temperature of the people entering a building in groups, where individual body temp. check is not possible using CCTV feeds. • Build a face detection-based solution which can identify student/employee and cross check with database repository, using CCTV feeds. The solution should include the following features: • Identify student/employee whose faces may be partially visible due to the varying angles at which CCTV cameras are typically placed • Handle people of different age, skin colour, gender and facial structure • Identify suspects with over 90% accuracy based on photographs of suspects provided as input • Throw an alert in real time as soon as ananyone in the crowd has a body temperature beyond the normal temperature, is detected. The video and associated timestamps should also be highlighted. • The system should also send alert of the student/employee who have not wear mask, to the Deptt. Head/organisation head, along with the individual, as a caution. • The attendance of the individual will also be registered through the CCTV feed and the data passed on to the Payroll system, for salary calculation and leave management applications. • Search for multiple individuals within multiple CCTV feeds concurrently.
