# Masked-Face-Recognition

A face recognition application that will also detect human identity even with face mask.

How to use this?
1. Run real_time_face_recognition.py, and then Press "S" to automatically crop and save your face inside the database floder. 
The accuracy will be lowered if we put image of a person who is not full face inside the database floder. More face features is required for masked face recognition.

2. Run the real_time_face_recognition.py again.
